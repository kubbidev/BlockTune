BlockTune is an experimental **Minecraft** plugin used in my build servers project that helps me with a few extra features, allowing me to create and manage blocks with ease.

It is:
* **fast** - written with performance and scalability in mind.
* **free** - available for download and usage at no cost, and permissively licensed so it can remain free forever.
